Leveraging the Google News API to create a basic logistical regression that can predict sentiment on a -1, 0, and 1 basis. The script is intended to take a keyword on this line, googlenews.get_news(''), and scrape all headlines with the presented name. Data exploration is needed to convert compound scores to whole numbers. Here I set the threshold at -.3 and .3 to round. This should change by exploration and is only intended to fit the logistical regression. The data is sent split into a training and testing set. The script allows for both TFIDF and Count vectorization.An accuracy score is produced along with summary statistics and F1 scoring.
